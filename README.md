# Hello guys. Rand0M here...
The quote I usually said in the video. (Subscribe to me @rand0mtutorial)

## About me
I always look like the newbie on coding because I don't make that many projects. And seem like the projects I made is not that quality as well.
When I code, I usually look up some guides on the google as well. But now, since the __ChatGPT__ has come. I will ask it instead

## My Skills (I guess) 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Basic)
* PHP (Basic)
* MySQL (Basic)
* Python
* C & C++ (Basic)
